This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-robustbase package of robustbase,
a package for GNU R that aims to provide 'essential' robust
statistics. Robusttools was written by Valentin Todorov, Andreas
Ruckstuhl, Matias Salibian-Barrera and Martin Maechler based on code
by Peter Rousseeuw and Christophe Croux and others, and is maintained
by Martin Maechler.

This package was created by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>. The
sources were downloaded from CRAN at 
	http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/

The package was renamed from its upstream name 'robustbase' to
'r-cran-robustbase' to fit the pattern of CRAN (and non-CRAN) packages for
R.

  Description: "Essential" Robust Statistics.  The goal is to provide
   tools allowing to analyze data with robust methods.  This includes
   regression methodology including model selections and multivariate
   statistics where we strive to cover the book "Robust Statistics,
   Theory and Methods" by Maronna, Martin and Yohai; Wiley 2006.
  Depends: R (>= 2.2.1), stats, graphics, methods
  Suggests: MASS
  LazyLoad: yes
  LazyData: yes

  and carries the note
  
     This file contains fortran functions for two new robust estimators
     of scale denoted as Qn and Sn, decribed in Rousseeuw and Croux (1993).
     These estimators have a high breakdown point and a bounded influence
     function. The implementation given here is very fast (running in
     O(n logn) time) and needs little storage space.
